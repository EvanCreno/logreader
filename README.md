## Developing

For building the app `node` and `npm` are required

### Building

Building the app can be done using the `Makefile`

```
make
```

### Automatic rebuilding during development

During development the webpack dev server can be used to automatically build the code
for every change.

Since the compiled source from the webpack dev server need to be injected in the regular Nextcloud
sources a proxy setup is needed to combine things.

If your local Nextcloud setup runs at http://localcloud an nginx configuration for the proxy
would look like the following:

```
server {
    listen 81;
    server_name localcloud;

    location /apps/logreader/build/main.js {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/build/main.js;
    }
    location /apps/logreader/build/main.css {
        return 404;
    }
    location /sockjs-node {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    }

    location / {
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_hide_header Content-Security-Policy;
        proxy_pass http://localcloud/;
    }
}

```

This will run the proxy at http://localcloud:81/

With the proxy configured you can start the webpack dev server and specify where the
Nextcloud proxy is.
 
```
PROXY_URL="http://localcloud:81/ make watch
```
